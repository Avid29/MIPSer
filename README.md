# Introduction

**Zarem** (Zippy Assembly Resolver, Emulator, & Manager) is a assembler, linker, emulator, and IDE education in assembly. It is very much a WIP, but the goal is to create the most accessible environment possible for learning to write assembly code.

# Assembly/Emulation Architectures

Zarem is currently MIPS only, but support for other architectures is planned.

| Architecture   | Assembling     | Linking     | Emulating       | Disassembly  |
| -------------- | -------------- | ----------- | --------------- | ------------ |
| MIPS32         | ✅ Supported  | ⚠️  WIP     | ⚠️  WIP         | ⚠️  WIP      |
| MIPS64         | ⌛ Planned    | ⌛ Planned  | ⌛ Planned      | ⌛ Planned   |
| ARM            | ⌛ Planned    | ⌛ Planned  | ⌛ Planned      | ⌛ Planned   |
| RISC-V         | ⌛ Planned    | ⌛ Planned  | ⌛ Planned      | ⌛ Planned   |

# Cross-Platform Support

The Zarem IDE is a WinUI 3 project, and therefore only available on Windows. **However**, the Assembler and Emulator are made in .NET 10 with no windows-only dependendencies, and therefore available on any machine with the .NET runtime.

| Assembler      | Emulator        | IDE          |
| -------------- | --------------- | ------------ |
| Cross-Platform | Cross-Platform  | Windows-Only | 

# Translation

Zarem supports localization for both the IDE and the Assembler. Assembler localization is integrated directly into the assembler, and is therefore available in the console as-well-as the Zarem IDE app.

Current languages:

| Language | IDE Support | Assembler Support |
| -------- | ----------- | ----------------- |
| English  | ✅ Yes     | ✅ Yes            |
| Hebrew   | ✅ Yes     | ✅ Yes            |
| Spanish  | ⌛ Planned | ⌛ Planned        |
