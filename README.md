# Introduction

**MIPSer** is an IDE for the MIPS assembly language. It is very much a WIP, but the goal is to create the most accessible environment possible for learning to write assembly code.

# Cross-Platform Usage

The MIPSer IDE is a WinUI 3 project, and therefore only available on Windows. **However**, the Assembler and Emulator are made in .NET 10 with no windows-only dependendencies, and therefore available on any machine with the .NET runtime.

| Assembler      | Emulator        | IDE          |
| -------------- | --------------- | ------------ |
| Cross-Platform | Cross-Platform  | Windows-Only | 

# Translation

MIPSer supports localization for both the IDE and the Assembler. Assembler localization is integrated directly into the assembler, and is therefore available in the console as-well-as the MIPSer IDE app.

Current languages:

| Language | IDE Support | Assembler Support |
| -------- | ----------- | ----------------- |
| English  | Yes         | Yes               |
| Hebrew   | Yes         | Yes               |
